Sorry all instructors and graders in cs61b,

We have to submit our project 1 day late after the deadline. 
The fact is that we spent too much time on the methods before "merge" method, 
and had too little time to think about the structures and complicated cases in "merge" method.
Fortunately, we find the structure of "merge" very clear after we organized the cases.
